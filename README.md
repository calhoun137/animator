Animator

An HTML5 sprite sheet animator

See http://calhoun137.github.io/animator/

Animator is a handy web-app to help anyone who wants to quickly preview animation sequences using a sprite sheet.

There really isn't much to it, you just drap and drop an image into the giant grey box, and then set the number of
frames in the X and Y directions, the time between each frame in milliseconds, and then you specify which frames to
animate and click animate to watch the magic happen!
